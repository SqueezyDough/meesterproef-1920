## Debriefing
### The client
We will build a web application for De Voorhoede.

### Voorgeschiedenis
De Voorhoede is looking for a better solution for their medicine scanner. They want to see if an application that uses Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) works better. The webapp can stay conceptual, meaning the webapp must be functional for at least 3 to 4 medicines. A large dataset is not required.

#### User Requirement List
- The app must use the registration numbers.
- The webapp must be usable for everyone, even if the user does not or cannot use the camera or webcam. A manual option to enter registration numbers is required.
- The user should be able to request the package leaflet of a medicine. A link to the leaflet is sufficent.
- The application must consist of at least a homepage, scanner page and results page. A page that show the scan history is optional and requires some extra attention to privacy.
